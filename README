Right now this bot does nothing but respond to the word "wiggle", mostly working on behind the scenes.

Currently working on an Sqlite3->SQL conversion so that the bot can import databases from Ankhbot and then can work standalone.

This bot requires sqlite to work, I'm hosting this from an Ubuntu machine, simply used a package:
sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev
I'd really really love to migrate out of Sqlite.
